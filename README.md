## Summary

NuGet Trends holds historical data of NuGet packages download numbers.
It's a useful tool for package maintainers to see the download rate of their packages and also for people interested in packages popularity over time.
The database has the complete [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/) catalog which include target framework information.
That means that there's a lot more features we can add, like TFM adoption overtime, dependency graphs etc.
